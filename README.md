This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
I am currently in INFM-109, looking to either finish a business or informatics degree. I am a pipefitter currently working for stellantis, the automotive industry seems to be getting more volitile than i would like so i am pursuing more education to make myself more marketable for worst case scenario.
